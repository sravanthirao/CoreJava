LinkedHashSet is also an implementation of Set interface, it is similar to the HashSet and TreeSet except the below mentioned differences:

HashSet doesn’t maintain any kind of order of its elements.
TreeSet sorts the elements in ascending order.
LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order.
Elements gets sorted in the same sequence in which they have been added to the Set.
