Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as Abstraction.
In java, we use abstract class(0 to 100%) and interface(100%)to achieve abstraction.

Abstract class:
A class that is declared as abstract is known as abstract class. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.
abstract class A{}

Abstract method:
A method that is declared as abstract and does not have implementation.
abstract void status();   // no body and abstract


Interface:
class implements an interface but one interface extends other interface

   Abstract class                                                                           Interface
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.                 1.Interface can have only abstract methods
2.Doesnot support multiple inheritance                                       2.Supports multiple inheritance.
3.Abstract class can have                                                    3. Only static and final variables.
static,nonstatic,final nonfinal variables.
4. Can provide implementation of interface                                   4.Cannot provide implementation of abstract class
5.abstract keyword is used to declare                                        5.interface keyword is used.
6.example:                                                                   6.
public abstract class A{                                                       public interface A{
public abstract void draw();                                                   void draw();
}                                                                              }
