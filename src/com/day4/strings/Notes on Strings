objects of String are immutable.
objects of string builder and string buffer are mutable.
String Buffer and String Builder are similar,but string builder is faster.
String builder is preferred over string buffer for single threaded program.
String buffer is preferred is thread safety is needed.

Heap memory is used to store objects in Java.(dynamic memory)
stack memory is used to store  local variables and function calls.(static memory)
