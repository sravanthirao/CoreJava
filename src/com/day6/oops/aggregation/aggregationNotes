Aggregation represents HAS-A relationship.

USE:
Code reuse is also best achieved by aggregation when there is no is-a relationship.
Inheritance should be used only if the relationship is-a is maintained throughout the lifetime of the objects involved;
otherwise aggregation is the best choice.

Aggregation is a special form of association. 
It is a relationship between two classes like association, however its a directional association, 
which means it is strictly a one way association. It represents a HAS-A relationship.

Aggregation Example in Java:
For example consider two classes Student class and Address class.
Every student has an address so the relationship between student and address is a Has-A relationship.
But if you consider its vice versa then it would not make any sense as an Address doesn’t need to have a Student 
necessarily.
Student Has-A Address
