Polymorphism: 
When one task is performed in different ways i.e. known as polymorphism.
In Java we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

Types:
1.compile time polymorphism(or)static polymorphism(or)Method overloading.
2.Run time polymorphism(or)dynamic polymorphism(or)Method overriding.

   Method overloading                                                  Method overriding
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.occurs within the same class.                                       1.occurs with 2 classes (super &sub).
2.Parameters must be different.                                       2.Parameters must be same.
3.return type may or maynot be same.                                  3.return type must be same.
                                   4.method name should be same in both
method overloading:same method name and same signature.
method overriding: same method name and different signature.
